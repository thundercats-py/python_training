    "(U) From the name of it you can see that **object-oriented programming** is oozing with abstraction and complication. Take heart: there's no need to fear or avoid object-oriented programming in Python! It's just another easy-to-use, flexible, and dynamic tool in the deep toolbox that Python makes available. In fact, we've been using objects and object oriented concepts ever since the first line of Python code that we wrote, so it's already familiar. In this lesson, we'll think more deeply about what it is that we've been doing all along, and how we can take advantage of these ideas. \n",

An **object** is just a convenient wrapper around a combination of some _data_ and _functionality_ related to that data, embodied in **methods**. Until now, you've probably thought of every `str` just in terms of its data, i.e. the literal string `\"Mark\"` that was used to assign the variable. The **methods** that work with `name` were defined just once, in a **class definition**, and apply to every string that is ever created. **Methods** are actually the same thing as functions that live _inside_ a class instead of _outside_ it.
