    "> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think \"I know, I'll use regular expressions.\" Now they have two \n",
    "problems. \n",
    "- Jamie Zawinski, 1997 \n",
    "\n",
    "(U) A regular expression is a tool for finding and capturing patterns in text strings. It is very powerful and can be very complicated; the second problem referred to in the quote is a commentary on how regular expressions are essentially a separate programming language. As a rule of thumb, use the in operator or string methods like `find` or `startswith` if they are suitable for the task. When things get more complicated, use regular expressions, but try to use them sparingly, like a seasoning. At times it may be tempting to write one giant, powerful, super regular expression, but that is probably not the best thing to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "(U) The power of regular expressions is found in the special characters. Some, like `^` and `$`, are roughly equivalent to string methods `startswith` and `endswith`, while others are more flexible, especially `.` and `*`, which allow flexible matching. "
