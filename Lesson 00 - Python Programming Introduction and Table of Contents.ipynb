    "\n",
    ">...in December, 1989, I was looking for a \"hobby\" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus) \n",

    "## (U) Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "(U) Python was designed to be easy and intuitive without sacrificing power, open source, and suitable for everyday tasks, with quick development times. It makes the layers between programming and problem solvingseem as thin as possible. It's suitable for: \n",
    "\n",
    "- (U) Opening an interactive session to solve the Daily Puzz. \n",
    "- (U) Writing a script that automates a tedious and time-consuming task,\n",
    "- (U) Creating a quick web service or an extensive web application, and \n",
    "- (U) Doing advanced mathematical research. \n",
    "\n",
    "(U) If you don't know any programming languages yet, Python is a good place to start. If you already know a different language, it's easy to pick Python up on the side. Python isn't entirely free of frustration and confusion, but hopefully you can avoid those parts until long after you get some good use out of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "(U) Programming is not a spectator sport! The more you practice programming, the more you will learn in this class, both in breadth and depth. Python practically teaches itself--the goal of your instructors is to guide you to the good parts and help you move just a little bit more quickly than you would otherwise. _Happy Programming!_\n",

    "## (U) Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "(U) The goal of this class is to help students accomplish work tasks more easily and robustly by programming in Python. To pass the course, each student must write at least one Python program that has substantial personal utility or is of significant personal interest. When choosing a project, students are encouraged to first think of work-related tasks. For students who need help getting started, several suggestions for possible projects are found at the bottom of this page. On the first day, instructors will lead a discussion where project ideas are discussed. \n",
    "\n",
    "(U) This class is designed for students of varying backgrounds and levels of experience, from complete novice to competent programmer. Asking each student to design and implement their own project allows everyone to learn and progress at an individual pace. "

    "(U~~//FOUO~~) This course is designed to be suitable for self-learning. Even if no formal offerings are available for your schedule, you may access and work on the modules of this course at any time. Even if you don't have access to a recent version of Python on a workstation or virtual machine, you can access a personalized Jupyter notebook available on LABBENCH . For an individual pursuing this self-study option, it is recommended to first cover the **Python Basics** roughly in order, then select as many of the **Useful Modules** as seem appropriate. You can also use this Jupyter notebook to experiment and write solutions to exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "(U~~//FOUO~~) One possibility for a group of potential students who start out with a different amounts of programming experience is to use Jupyter as a self-study tool until everyone has a basic understanding of programming, then follow up with an abbreviated instructor-led course (anywhere from two days to a week or more, depending on needs).

    "\n",
    "(U) For a two week course: there will be a morning lecture and an afternoon lecture every day. The morning lecture will last between an hour and ninety minutes; the afternoon lecture will be somewhat shorter. **If a lecture is going too fast, please ask questions to slow us down!** If it's going too slow, feel free to work ahead on your own. \n",
    "\n",
    "(U~~//FOUO~~) You will use Python within your own environment. See [setup](setup.ipynb) for instructions on getting software installed. While we will point out some differences between the Python 3.x and 2.x lines, this course will focus on Python 3. If you need or want to run Python on Linux, we'll work with you. To the extent possible, we will write code in a platform-agnostic manner and point out features that are unique to specific versions of Python. _(Note: Paragraph rewritten to make sense without redactions)_\n",
    "\n",
    "(U) Although lectures will only take up two or three hours each day, we encourage you to spend the remainder of your day programming in Python, either on your own or in groups, but in the classroom if possible. At least one instructor will be available in the classroom during normal business hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "(U) This course is a work in progress; we welcome all suggestions. There are more **Useful Modules** than we can hope to cover in a two-week class; instructors will take a vote to determine which modules to cover. If there is another topic that you would like to have covered, especially along the lines of \"How would I do `x`, `y`, or `z` in Python?\", please ask--if there's enough interest we'll cover it in a lecture. We'd even be happy to have you contribute to the course documentation! Talk to an instructor to find out how."
