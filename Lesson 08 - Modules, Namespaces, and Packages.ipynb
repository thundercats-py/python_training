    "(U) When working in Jupyter, you don't have to worry about your code disappearing when you exit. You can save the notebook and share it with others. A Jupyter notebook kind of behaves like a python **script**: a text file containing Python source code. You can give that file to the python interpreter on the command line and execute all the code in the file (kind of like \"Run All\" in a Jupyter notebook): \n",

    "\n",
    "1. what if you want to share with somebody who has python installed but not Jupyter? \n",
    "2. what if you want to share _part_ of the code with others (or reuse part of it yourself)? \n",
    "3. what if you're writing a large, complex program? \n",

    "2. copy-paste...? \n",

    "(U) On the command line, the standard tool for installing a package is `pip`, Python's package manager. (`pip` ships with Python by default nowadays, but if you're using an older version, you may have to install it yourself.) To use `pip`, you need to configure it to point at a package repository. The big repository everyone uses is called PyPI (a.k.a. the Cheese Shop)."
