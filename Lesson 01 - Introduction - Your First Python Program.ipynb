    "# Basic Basics: Data and Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic data types in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numbers\n",
    "    - Integer `<type 'int'>` (these are \"arbitrary precision\"; no need to worry about whether it's 32 bits or 64 bits, etc.)\n",
    "    - Float `<type 'float'>` (think of floats as fast decimals; they're actually decimal representations of binary floating point numbers so there are some accuracy issues when a decimal number doesn't have an exact binary representation)\n",
    "    - Complex `<type 'complex'>` (Imaginary numbers)\n",
    "- Strings `<type 'str'>`\n",
    "    - No difference between single and double quotes\n",
    "    - Escape special characters with `\\`, (e.g. quotation marks)\n",
    "    - Raw string `r'raw string'` prevents need for some escapes.\n",
    "    - Triple-quotes allow multi-line strings\n",
    "    - Unicode `u'Bert \\x26 Ernie' <type 'unicode'>`\n",
    "- Booleans: `True` and `False`, `<type 'bool'>`\n",
    "\n",
    "We operate on data using\n",
    "\n",
    "- **operators**, e.g. mathematical operators `+`, `-`; the keyword `in`, and others\n",
    "- **functions**, which are operations that take one or more pieces of data as arguments, e.g. `type('hello')`, `len('world')`, and \n",
    "- **methods**, which are attached to a piece of data and called from it using a `.` to separate the data from the method, e.g. `'Hello World'.split()`, or `'abc'.upper()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep in the guts of Python, these are all essentially the same thing, but syntactically and pedagogically it makes sense to separate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pieces of basic data can be stored inside containers, including\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "but we'll introduce those later.\n",

    "- `help(x)`: shows interactive help.\n",

    "- `isinstance(a,b)`: tells if object `a` is an instance of type `b`; something like `type(a) == b`\n",
    "- `print(x)`: prints the string representation of `x` to the console\n",
    "- `hasattr(a,b)`: tells whether `a` has an attribute with name `b`; something like `b in dir(a)`\n",
    "- `getattr(obj, 'name')`: Get a named attribute from an object; something like `obj.name`\n",
    "- `id(obj)`: Get the unique identity of an instance of an object. Memory address.\n",
    "- `input(prompt)`: Read a string from standard input. The string supplied in prompt is printed before reading the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor functions usually try to do their best with the arguments you give, and return the appropriate data of the requested type:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `str`: turns numbers (and other things) into their string representations.\n",
    "- `int`: truncates `float`, parses `str`ings containing a single integer\n",
    "- `float`: parses `str`ings, gives float representation of `int`s\n",
    "- `complex`: takes `(real,imag)` numeric arguments, or parses a `str` for a single number\n",
    "\n",
    "Other functions only work with one or two types of data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numbers: \n",
    "    - Functions: `abs`, `round`, `float`, `max`, `min`, `pow` (modular), `chr`, `divmod`, etc. \n",
    "    - Operators: Standard math, bitwise: `<<`,`>>`,`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`\n",
    "    - Methods: Numeric classes don't have methods\n",
    "- Strings:\n",
    "    - Functions: `len`, `min`, `max`, `ord`\n",
    "    - Operators: `+`, `*` (with a number), `in`\n",
    "    - Methods: `strip`, `split`, `startswith`, `upper`, `find`, `index`, many more; use `dir('any string')` to find more\n",
